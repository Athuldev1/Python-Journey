Auction Bid Project

This project is a simple auction bidding system where multiple users can place bids, and the highest bid is determined at the end.

Features

Input Validation: Ensures that the bidder's name contains only letters and that the bid price is a positive integer.
Interactive: The program allows multiple users to place bids until no more bids are made.
Clear Screen: Clears the screen after each bid for a cleaner user interface (works on both Windows and Unix systems).
Highest Bid: Determines and displays the highest bid at the end of the auction.
