Reeborg's Maze Solver

This project contains a Python script designed to solve a maze in the Reeborg's World environment. The script instructs Reeborg, a programmable robot, to navigate from the starting point to the goal by making appropriate movements and turns based on the conditions of the maze.

Introduction

Reeborg's Maze Solver uses basic conditional statements and a while loop to control Reeborg's movements through the maze. The script makes decisions based on whether the path ahead and to the right are clear, allowing Reeborg to reach the goal efficiently.

Features

Defines a turn_right() function to simplify Reeborg's right turn movements.
Uses a while loop to continuously check if Reeborg has reached the goal.
Employs conditional statements to decide when Reeborg should move forward, turn right, or turn left.

Installation
To use this script, you need access to the Reeborg's World environment. You can access it online at Reeborg's World.
