About the Project
This game challenges players to compare the follower counts of two randomly selected famous personalities, brands, or entities, and guess which one has more followers. The goal is to maintain a streak by making correct guesses.

How to Play

The game displays two options: "A" and "B".
The player must decide which option has more followers and type either "A" or "B".
If the guess is correct, the score increases and the game continues with a new option to compare.
The game ends when the player makes an incorrect guess, showing the final score.
The player is then given the option to restart the game.
