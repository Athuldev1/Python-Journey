Caesar Cipher Project

This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features

Encoding and Decoding: The program can encode and decode messages based on a user-provided shift value.
Handles Large Shifts: The program can handle shift values greater than the length of the alphabet by taking the modulus of the shift.
Keeps Special Characters: Non-alphabetic characters are retained in the final output without any changes.
Interactive: The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to encode or decode multiple messages until they choose to exit.
